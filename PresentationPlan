Reproduce:
1. Download the publically avaailable data: 
  Hedenfalk et al. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200102223440801
      - Data: http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/microarray/NEJM_Supplement/
      - Tab deliminated file
  Brem et al. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11923494
      - Data: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37
      - GEO data. May be easiest since our homework is simliar
  Rodwell et al. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15562319
      - Data: http://smd.princeton.edu/cgi-bin//publication/viewPublication.pl?pub_no=409
      - Data found in three files. Would hesitate to use these as would need to merge


Notes:
- R package found at: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html
- Analyze using the log scale


Next Steps (Once below questions are answered):
  - Read paper in detail
  - Determine which dataset we want to work with
      - Run analysis on dataset(s)
  - Compile/Review Data
  - Create presentation/Rmd
  - PRESENT! 

Todos/Questions to Ask: 
- How many datasets to reproduce? Only need 1 
- How long of presentation? 35 mins
- What format do we want? Rmd


Algorithm Steps:
1. Remove signal due to primary variables --> Produces a residual expression matrix
   Identify signatures of expression heterogeneity (EH) by applyng a decomposition to the matrix
   Determine the singular vectors that completely reproduce the EH signatures
2. Identify the subset of genes driving each EH signature through significance analysis
3. For each subset of genes, build a surrogate variable based on full EH signature
4. Include all significant surrogate variables as covariates in subsequenct regression analyses
