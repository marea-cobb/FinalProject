Gene expression studies:
  - characterize transcriptiuonal variation with respect to measured variables of interest (enivornments, treatmetns, times, etc.)
  - Failing to include unmodeled or unmeasured factors and gene speicifc noise can lead to a decrease power tot detect associations 

Primary measured variables:
  - variables that are explicitly modeled in the analysis of an expression study

Unmodeled factors: 
  - sorces of variation that tare explained by measured variables, but ar not explicitly includied in the statistical model 

Unmeasured factors:
  - sources of expression variation that are not measured in the course of the study

Gene-sepcific noise:
  - random fluctuations in gene expression indpenedently realized from gene to gene

Expression Heterogeneity (EH):
  - Descirbes patterns of variation due to any unmodeled factor
  - particularly expressed in human expression data and complex systems

Sources of expression variation
  - technical
  - environmenttal
  - demographic
  - genetic factors

Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA):
  - Identify, estimate, and utilize the components of expression heterogeneity
  - Improves accuracy and consistetncy in detecting differential expression
  - Helps produce reproducible results in microarray studies
  - borrows information across genes to estimate the alrge-scale effects of unmodeled factors directtly
  - captures signatures of EH and inputs them into analysis as covariates

Analysis Steps:
  1. Remove signals of primary variables, creating a residual expression matrix (REM). Apply a decomposition to the REM to identify signatures of EH. Use a statistical test to determine singular vectors that respent significantly more variation then is expected by chance.
  2. Identtify subset of genes driving each signature of EH thtrough analysis of associations between genes and EH signatures on REM.
  3. For each subset of genes, build a surrogate variable based on the full EH signature of that subset in original expression data
  4. Include all significant surrogatet variables as covariates in subsequent regression analyes
